# Artificial-Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence final project
* Introduction

 For this project we implemented a very interesinting system called basketball trainning system using a very advanced algorithm called artificial neural network. We used Artificial neural network to simulator five people, which matched the fact that there are five people on the court. The player would make the decision accoridng to the current situation on the court.

* What is Artificial neural network(wiki)

 In machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of models inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" which exchange messages between each other. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.

 For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a function (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

 Like other machine learning methods - systems that learn from data - neural networks have been used to solve a wide variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based programming, including computer vision and speech recognition.


* Instructions

 For your convience, I even did not delete the debug file in this project. You cau use Visual Studio 2010 to open the project and run.
